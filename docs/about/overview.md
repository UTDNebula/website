Nebula Labs is an initiative to build tools that help students at The
University of Texas at Dallas. We're a community of student developers and
designers who make college life easier through projects.

This website contains information about what projects are a part of Nebula Labs
along with how it is organized. It also contains documentation for
[maintainers](/docs/maintainers/overview) on how to contribute, including theming
and code style information.

**To get involved, see our [roles](/docs/about/roles/overview) page.**
