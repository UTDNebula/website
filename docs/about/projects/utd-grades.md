UTD Trends is a tool that lets students view historical grade distributions,
course evaluation data, and more from previously taught class sections.

UTD Trends is in part supported by both The [Mercury](https://utdmercury.com), and
the [Nebula Labs API Team](/docs/about/projects/api.md). To
obtain the historical grades data, the Mercury submits a Freedom of Information
Act request shortly after a semester ends, and then Nebula Labs uploads that
data to the UTD Trends database. This data is then processed by our backend team
and is augmented by data gathered through web scraping.

## History

UTD Grades was created by [Bharat Arimilli](https://www.arimilli.io/), former
web editor for the Mercury, based off a concept by [UNT Grades](https://untgrades.com/),
a website built by [Jeffrey Wang](https://jeffw.xyz/) while he was a student the
Texas Academy of Mathematics and Science at the University of North Texas. The
project was built as a part of [ACM UTD's](https://acmutd.co) Labs initiative
and maintained by its team. In summer 2021, UTD Grades became a Nebula Labs
project to give it better focus.

In fall 2021, Nebula Labs announced that UTD Grades would get an upgrade due
for spring 2022. This upgrade would revamp the interface to provide more
information to students.

In spring 2022, Nebula Labs split with ACM, and handed maintenance of UTD Grades
to ACM Development. Nebula Labs subsequently rebranded the UTD Grades upgrade to
UTD Trends and continued development.
