The UTD Survival Guide is a personalized student guide containing everything a
student would want to know about how to survive and thrive at UTD. It acts as a
knowledge base and reference for various of aspects of student life, like how to
perform well academically, how to find friends and get involved socially, and how
to get an internship or other career opportunity, all in one easily-accessible
place.

## Motivation

For some students, college life comes easily. For other students, like
first-generation students those from non-traditional backgrounds, like student
veterans or those going through undergrad after joining the workforce, going to
university can be a dizzing or confusing experience. The Guide is an attempt to
make their lives easier while consolidating information that's accessible to and
digestible by all students.

## History

Willie Chalmers III, then a rising sophomore at UTD in summer 2020, wanted to
share his knowledge about campus to help incoming students through their
freshman years. He was inspired by [Veda Tsai](https://www.linkedin.com/in/veda-tsai),
a peer advisor he had during the 2019 [Clark Summer Research Program](https://honors.utdallas.edu/clark-summer-research-program)
and her "How-to Class" presentation that discuseed tips and tricks for getting
through college. He was also inspired by the Nickelodeon TV show
[_Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ned%27s_Declassified_School_Survival_Guide)
and wanted to provide a quick reference to answer commonly asked questions on
the unofficial UT Dallas subreddit ([r/utdallas](https://reddit.com/r/utdallas)).

He _really_ wanted to build this to answer questions on the UT Dallas subreddit.
A lot.

In summer 2020, the first draft of content for the Guide was started
indpendently from other groups. In summer 2021, it became a part of Project
Nebula and in fall 2021, it gained a dedicated project lead.

The first iteration of the UTD Survival Guide is due to relase in spring 2022.

## Features

### A Wide Variety of Information on Student Life

It seems like there are dozens of places to get information but that they're
scattered throughout university websites, isolated in external websites like
Rate My Professors, and hidden in online forums like [r/utdallas](https://reddit.com/r/utdallas).
The Guide contains academic, personal, and career information for students of
all majors in one place.

Have you ever been asked "What is a "Tobor"?" or "Who is Enarc?"? Have you ever
wondered how to balance working part time with being a full-time student? How
about how to survive on a budget? The Guide helps you answer all of those questions.

### A Personalized Guide Experience (Coming soon!)

Let's say you're a pre-med student majoring in computer science (whoosh). It's
already difficult being a computer science major, but how do you balance that
with the needs of medical school admissions? Based on your academic and career
interests, Guide will collect and suggest material tailored to your needs.
Additionally, it will give you clear milestones so you can check off what really
matters during your time in college.

### Intuitive and Useful Search (Coming soon!)

Ever need to find that _one_ bit of information or that _one_ fact about that
_one_ thing you were sure you knew? The Guide will let you search for everything
from university resources to notable people, places, or groups at UTD.
