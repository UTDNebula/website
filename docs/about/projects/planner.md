title: Nebula Planner
description: The Nebula Planner is a degree planning tool that makes planning and tracking coursework intuitive and simple.
---

The Nebula Planner was made to do one thing: help students plan their college
experience at a high level. It does the leg work so students can focus less on
the minutiae of planning their studies and more on the experiences that will
prepare them as scholars and as members of society.

## Motivation

Planner was born out of a need to replace ad hoc Google Docs and hastily-crafted
spreadsheets when planning coursework.

While Planner was primarily inspired by undergraduate academic advising in the
Erik Jonsson School of Engineering Computer Science, later inquiries with
students from other schools at UTD revealed similar deficiencies or uncertainty
when planning coursework.

Additionally, students today more than ever have strong career expectations
placed on them. For many people, it's not enough to only graduate. Students are
increasingly expected to do things outside the classroom, like participate in
volunteer work

## Project History

Nebula Planner began its life as Comet Planning, a degree planning tool. It was
one of the inaugural projects developed by ACM Engineering (formerly ACM
Development) with the following contributors:

- [Aliah Shaira De Guzman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aliahdg), project lead
- [Medha Aiyah](https://www.linkedin.com/in/medha-aiyah), front-end developer
- [Aishani De Sirkar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aishanids), front-end developer
- [Willie Chalmers III](https://www.linkedin.com/in/willie-chalmers-iii), back-end developer

The [initial commit](https://github.com/UTDNebula/planner/commit/99e6e0b4d975a917a092537e36b368695f9bc8b6)
was made on May 9, 2020 by Aliah.

Early on, its purpose was clear: build a tool that let people visualize their
coursework by dragging and dropping it in a clean interface. Sometime near the
end of summer 2020, Willie was asked to be Comet Planning's project lead and
directly oversaw the project after that.

Over the next year, the project would increase in scope and grow to emphasize
a more holistic experience when planning coursework.

At ACM UTD's spring 2021 kickoff, Comet Planning was renamed to "Project
Nebula" with its name strongly inspired by Madison York, the editor-in-chief
of the [Mercury](https://utdmercury.com) who helped him brainstorm names over
hot chocolate.

Over summer 2021, Project Nebula grew to encompass several interconnected
projects: a degree planning tool (named Nebula), a public API and visualization
dashboard for UTD-related data (Comet Data Service), and later, a guide for
students (UTD Survival Guide).

Around September 2021, it was handed over to [Rajmeet Juneja](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rajmeetjuneja/)
so Willie could more effectively oversee Project Nebula as a whole. Also around
this time, Project Nebula's degree planning tool was renamed to the Nebula
Planner to reduce confusion between it and the larger initiative to build
tools that helped students.

On January 24, 2022, the Nebula Planner (finally!) announced its public beta at
ACM UTD's spring 2021 kick-off.

## Features

### Degree Planning

Nebula Planner lets you visualize what courses you're taking across your entire
academic career. No need to keep an unwieldy spreadsheet or text document up to
date. Simply drag and drop courses between semesters.

### Prerequisite Visualization (Coming soon!)

Some majors have many interconnected courses with chains of prerequisites.
Nebula Planner will let you visualize them in an easy-to-understand way and
track which courses you have left to take.

### Degree Plan Validation (Coming soon!)

Knowing what courses to take is already difficult enough, but it's also
difficult to keep track of edge cases and how they'll affect other aspects of
being a student. What if dropping a course will no longer make you a full-time
student? How will withdrawing for a semester affect your financial aid? Nebula
Planner will intelligently help you verify that your plan is in line with academic
policies in the Catalog.

### Historical Courses and Professor Evaluation Integration (Coming soon!)

Sometimes you want to take a course with a specific professor. Nebula Planner
will integrate with the UTD Survival Guide and the Nebula API to display
historical course information to let you determine how difficult your semester
will be and what to expect when taking a class.

### Plan Sharing and Export (Coming soon!)

Perhaps someone has asked you what your degree plan looks like in the past.
Instead of giving them a screenshot of a document, why not give them a link
that lets them experiment with it and apply it to their own? Nebula Planner will
let you generate a link to your degree plan, which you can share with your
academic advisor or friends.

It will also let you export your plan to file, whether to image, to PDF, or to a
spreadsheet.

### Planning Co-curricular Experiences (Coming soon!)

Some degree plans require out-of-class experiences, and some career paths
encourage summer activities like internships or research experiences to be
competitive. Nebula Planner will let you keep track of internships and other
activities that complement your coursework all in once place.

### Advanced Degree Planning (Coming soon!)

To plan master's degrees for Fast Track while aligning graduate coursework with
undergraduate coursework, students have to do even more work. But what if you're
also in the [Collegium V Honors Program](https://honors.utdallas.edu/cv) and
have additional requirements to graduate? Why not just let Nebula Planner figure
out all the edge cases?

Nebula Planner will allow you to keep track of school requirements that may
like University-wide honors, major honors, Fast Track coursework, and more.
