The Nebula API is a public API for accessing university-related data, consisting
of endpoints to access archived data in addition to live, up-to-date data.

## Motivation

In short, without Nebula API, no programmatic way of accessing
university-related data. Some students at UT Dallas have made innnovative tools
like Discord bots to view dining services times or to see parking availability
on campus, but these involve implementing boilerplate just to get the data they
need.

The Nebula API is meant to be a public data layer for cool projects and is meant
to encourage students to build cool personal projects that work for them using
data that's easily accessible.

## History

The Nebula API originally began in summer 2020 as the Comet Data Service, an
admin dashboard to store and aggregate course information for the Nebula Planner
(which was called Comet Planning at the time). [Sunny Guan](https://www.sguan.me/)
and [Saloni Shivdasani](https://www.linkedin.com/in/saloni-s) contributed during
this time.

At [HackUTD VIII](https://hackutd.co) in fall 2021, hackers tested and built
projects with the Nebula API as part of a alpha preview. As a result, the
[Comet Circle](https://devpost.com/software/comet-clique) team was invited to
Nebula Labs to work on similar useful tools. Comet Circle was redeployed to
[heatmap.utdnebula.com](https://heatmap.utdnebula.com) for public use.
