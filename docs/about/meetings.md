Nebula Labs is a collection of open source initiatives primarily
operated from The University of Texas at Dallas main campus.

All meetings are open to the public unless otherwise noted, so feel free to drop
in and get involved!

The simplest way to get involved is through joining our [Discord][discord link].

If you need assistance, reach out to anyone with the "Leadership" role in the Discord.

## Product Meetings

Each product team meets independently to assign tasks, discuss roadblocks, and act as a morale
check for maintainers.

These are the days and times each team regularly meets:

## Division Meetings

Nebulas' divisions also meet regularly to disseminate division-specific information (new technologies, standard practicies, knowledge transfer) and encourage cross-team communication about project status.

  visible on campus.

## After Hours

After Hours is a Nebula Labs initiative to provide recruits, members, and leadership a dedicated time to work through anything that may not fit within the scope of the above meetings. Members are encouraged to come to after hours with technical issues, questions about the organization, or a desire to get to know other Nebula Labs members!

**For the Spring 2023 Semester, After Hours will be hosted every Tuesday at 7:00 PM in SCI 1.210**

## Leadership Meetings

The Nebula Labs Leadership Team meets on a limited basis to
discuss aspects of its governance and strategic direction. These meetings are generally not open to general membership, but open forums may be held to gather feedback concerning developments within the organization.

| Group           | Frequency      | Where                   |
| --------------- | -------------- | ----------------------- |
| Officer Team    | Once per month | [Discord][discord link] |
| Leadership Team | Once per month | [Discord][discord link] |
| Project Council | Once per month | Ad hoc                  |
| Division Heads  | Once per month | Ad hoc                  |

- Project Council meetings happen on an individual or group basis depending on preference of Project Leads and the Executive Director. These meetings serve to address day-to-day issues with projects and encourage the transfer of information from the Project Leads to the Officer Team.
- Division Head meetings happen on an individual or group basis depending on preference of Division Heads and the Vice President. These meetings address division-wide issues concerning best practices and standards. They provide an opportunity for the Vice President to control the strategic direction of the organization.
- Leadership Team meetings are group meetings with all members of leadership to discuss and get feedback about organization governance.
- Officer Team meetings are group meetings with the five officers to discuss and develop organization wide policies and procedures.

## Socials

Socials are scheduled on an ad hoc basis, but we're planning for a few:

- Nebula Mini Hack Weekend
- Nebula Barbeque
- Nebula Field Day
