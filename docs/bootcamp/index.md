and then **[get started](#get-started)**.

## What is Boot Camp?

Nebula Labs is a student organization that aims to help students learn and
develop skills in web development. To achieve this goal, the organization has
developed a comprehensive tutorial program covering HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
TypeScript, React, and Next.js. The program, called Boot Camp, is designed to
cater to students with varying levels of experience, from beginners to advanced
learners.

The program begins with HTML and CSS tutorials from Freecodecamp, which provide
a solid foundation for web development. Students learn how to create basic web
pages and style them using CSS. They also learn about responsive design, which
is critical for creating websites that work on different devices and screen
sizes.

After mastering HTML and CSS, students move on to JavaScript and TypeScript
tutorials from MDN docs. JavaScript is a crucial programming language used in
web development, and TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that provides
additional features such as static typing, making it easier to write and
maintain code. In these tutorials, students learn about variables, data types,
functions, arrays, objects, loops, conditionals, and other fundamental concepts
of programming.

With a solid understanding of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and TypeScript, students
then move on to React tutorials from the official React documentation. React is
a popular JavaScript library used for building user interfaces. Students learn
how to create components, manage state, handle events, and use React hooks to
add functionality to their applications.

Finally, students learn about Next.js, a framework for building server-side
rendered React applications, from the official Next.js documentation. With
Next.js, students can create fast and SEO-friendly web applications that can
handle a high volume of traffic. They learn how to create pages, routes, and
dynamic content using data fetching.

Overall, the tutorial program from Nebula Labs is comprehensive and
well-structured, covering all the essential concepts and tools required for web
development. By the end of the program, students should have the skills and
knowledge needed to build their own web applications using HTML, CSS,
JavaScript, TypeScript, React, and Next.js.

## Get Started

Before you start with Nebula Labs tutorial program, you'll need to set up a
development environment and install the prerequisite technology. You can choose
to install tools onto your local machine or use a cloud-based code editing
tools.

### Local Development

You can use any text editor or IDE (Integrated Development Environment) of your
choice to write HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, and Next.js code.
Some popular options include Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, Atom, and
WebStorm.

Here are the prerequisite technologies you'll need to install to follow along
with the Nebula Labs tutorial program:

#### Git

Git is a version control system used for tracking changes in code. You'll need
to install Git on your computer to clone the repositories used in the
tutorials. You can download Git from the official website:
https://git-scm.com/downloads

#### Node.js

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment used for running JavaScript code
outside of a web browser. You'll need to install Node.js on your computer to
run the React and Next.js applications. You can download Node.js from the
official website: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

Once you've installed Git and Node.js, you can open up your terminal or command
prompt and check that they're installed correctly by running the following
commands:

```
git --version
node --version
npm --version
```

If everything is installed correctly, you should see the version number for
Git, Node.js, and npm (Node Package Manager).

That's it! You're now ready to get started with the Nebula Labs tutorial
program.

### Cloud-based Code Editing Tools

Cloud-based code editing tools can be a great option for those who don't want
to install software on their local machine. Two popular options are GitHub
Codespaces and Gitpod.

#### GitHub Codespaces

GitHub Codespaces allows you to create a cloud-based development environment
that is accessible from anywhere with an internet connection. You can use
Codespaces to write, run, and debug your code, as well as collaborate with
others.

To use Codespaces, you'll need a GitHub account and a repository with your
code. You can then create a new Codespace for your repository by clicking the
"Code" button and selecting "New Codespace". This will create a new virtual
machine with your code pre-installed and ready to go.

For more information on getting started with GitHub Codespaces, check out the
official documentation: https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/getting-started

#### Gitpod

Gitpod is another cloud-based code editing tool that provides a fully
configured development environment in the cloud. You can use Gitpod to write,
run, and debug your code, as well as collaborate with others.

To use Gitpod, you'll need a GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket account and a
repository with your code. You can then create a new Gitpod workspace for your
repository by adding "gitpod.io#" to the beginning of your repository's URL.
For example, if your repository URL is
"https://github.com/username/repository", you can create a Gitpod workspace by
visiting "https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/username/repository".

For more information on getting started with Gitpod, check out the official
documentation: https://www.gitpod.io/docs/getting-started/

#### Free Usage Limits

Cloud-based tools can be very helpful, but full usage is often paid. Luckily,
most services offer generous free tiers.

GitHub Codespaces offers a free tier that includes:

- Up to 6 hours of continuous usage per month
- 50 GB of storage per user
- A single, shared CPU
