## Overview

Project Nebula is an initiative to build tools that help students. We strive to create interfaces and experiences that fit their needs.

The Head of Design takes on a more interdisciplinary role. The Head of Design maintains Project Nebula’s identity and ensures that it fits the criteria of a college students’ work, but with the professionalism of a real company.

The Head of Design is responsible for making Project Nebula appear friendly, inviting, and trustworthy. The role is also responsible for reinforcing those ideas throughout everything we create. Our goal is to shape Project Nebula’s identity to align with the current design trends and create modern interfaces.

Project Nebula uses a modern theme to format and create its programs. The Head of Design is expected to have a foundation in design that can tie into the current brand and visual identity. You will create graphics that are aesthetically pleasing to a college students’ eye.

## What We Need

The Head of Design is responsible for coming up with Project Nebula’s identity and keeping it aligned with what features our projects offer and the needs of students.

We’re looking for someone with the following:

- A keen intuition for good designs that fit an aesthetic

- Ability to synthesize intention into a visual form
- A portfolio of graphic design
- Ability to translate ideas
- Ability to respond well to feedback and critique

Any of these may additionally help:

- Experience designing vector graphics
- Experience using design tools such as Figma or Adobe XD

We’re all students, so we understand that someone won’t be an expert in anything. If you don’t have all the skills, you will most certainly learn as a part of the Project Nebula team!

## What You'll Do

Responsibilities:

- Attending monthly Project Nebula meetings

- Work closely with the Head of Product and User Experience Lead to design user interfaces for all of Project Nebula’s projects
- Design graphics for internal documentation

Expect to spend around 4 hours per week in this role.

- Creating accessible color palettes and user interfaces
- How to make mock-ups and wireframes
