## Design Philosophy

Nebula Labs aims for a healthy mix between functionality and fun, playful
design but always errs on the side of functionality. We acknowledge that design
is not just about building pretty interfaces; design is a process that combines
art and human psychology to create beautiful and useful experiences.

We aim for accessible, inclusive design. We mean to build tools for as many
students as possible, so we have an eye for detail when implementing features.

Sometimes we may design user experiences that may need to change. We stray away
from needless updates that don't bring value to our users, but we are always
welcome to feedback so we know when we should change.

For us, design isn't merely about building interfaces. Design is a process, a
whole pipleine encompassing everything from developing user stories to using
data-driven approaches to optimize user experience.

## Some Details

Nebula Labs's design aesthetic is heavily adapted from Google's
[Material Design](https://material.io/design) guidelines. If you are thinking
about building something big (or even small), start there as that will frame how
you design anything else for Nebula Labs.

Nebula Labs has a set of components ([Nebula Components](https://github.com/UTDNebula/components))
for common UI/UX elements. Use them when possible.
