## Overview

Nebula Labs is an initiative to build tools that help students. At a high level, designers for Nebula Labs focus on defining the general design language shared across all our projects. Designers may also design graphics, ui mock-ups, and other digital assets for our various products.

This description is general for all of Nebula Labs’s projects, but your desired project may have specific responsibilities that you can ask a project lead about.

## What You’ll Do

Your general responsibilities would be:

- Attending weekly team meetings
- Collaborating with your project lead and the Head of Design to implement mock-ups
- Keeping in touch with your project lead
- Keep in touch with the Head of Design to ensure a cohesive design language

## Time Commitment

Dedicate as much (or as little!) time as you'd like to working on our projects. Consistency and communication are valued.

## What You'll Learn

At Nebula Labs, we value teaching our members highly employable skills that aren't always taught in the classroom. In the Nebula Labs design division, you might learn how to...

- Design user-facing applications
- Employ design principles to make intuitive interfaces
- Create wireframes or mock-ups
- Use industry-standard tools like Figma and Canva
