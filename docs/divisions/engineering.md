## Overview

Nebula Labs is an initiative to build tools that help students with both back-end and front-end developers.

Back-end developers for Nebula Labs build and maintain the core infrastructure that allow front-end developers to create robust user experiences.

Additionally, developers for Nebula Labs play an active role on the team and are encouraged to take part in discussions for designing and creating new features for products.

This description is general for all of Nebula Labs’s projects, but your desired project may have specific responsibilities that you can ask a project lead about.

## What You’ll Do

Your general responsibilities would be:

- Attending weekly team meetings when possible
- Building either front-end or back-end solutions

On a day-to-day basis, you would:

- Keep in touch with your project lead about your progress
- Engage in discussions on GitHub about the issues
- Read and write technical documentation for your project

## Time Commitment

Dedicate as much (or as little!) time as you'd like to working on our projects. Consistency and communication are valued.

## What You'll Learn

At Nebula Labs, we value teaching our members highly employable skills that aren't always taught in the classroom. On a Nebula Labs team, you might learn how to...

- Utilize database tools to store and retrieve data
- Read and write technical documentation
- Use Git and GitHub to manage software versioning
- Build and use APIs
- Efficiently develop a high-impact project with a team
