## Overview

Nebula Labs is an initiative to build tools that help students. Members of the marketing team focus on creating and dispersing assets to help Nebula Labs reach more students. The marketing team may also network with other organizations to expand our footprint outside ECS.

This description is general for all of Nebula Labs’s projects, but your desired project may have specific responsibilities that you can ask a project lead about.

## What You’ll Do

Your general responsibilities would be:

- Attending weekly team meetings
- Keeping in touch with the Head of Marketing to ensure team alignment
- Creating posters, digital assets, and more for projects and the Nebula Labs brand

## Time Commitment

Dedicate as much (or as little!) time as you'd like to working on our projects. Consistency and communication are valued.

## What You'll Learn

At Nebula Labs, we value teaching our members highly employable skills that aren't always taught in the classroom. On a Nebula Labs team, you might learn how to...

- Create a compelling campaign in a well-defined market
- Use industry standard tools such as Figma and Canva to craft digital assets
- Manage a social media account
