## Overview

Nebula Labs is an initiative to build tools that help students. Members of the product team direct the strategy of the organization and its projects through conducting market research, creating customer personas, and gathering direct and indirect feedback from students.

This description is general for all of Nebula Labs’s projects, but your desired project may have specific responsibilities that you can ask a project lead about.

## What You’ll Do

Your general responsibilities would be:

- Attending weekly team meetings
- Keeping in touch with the Head of Product to discuss organizational strategy
- Talking with students about campus issues
- Creating and conducting surveys

## Time Commitment

Dedicate as much (or as little!) time as you'd like to working on our projects. Consistency and communication are valued.

## What You'll Learn

At Nebula Labs, we value teaching our members highly employable skills that aren't always taught in the classroom. On a Nebula Labs team, you might learn how to...

- Conduct market research
- Use tools such as Google Forms and Sheets to collect, organize, and present findings
- Write informed recommendations concerning project direction
- Draft high level requirements grounded in user research
