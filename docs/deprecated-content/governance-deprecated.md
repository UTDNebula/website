## Structure

Nebula Labs is led by the Head of Nebula Labs who has ultimate discretion
over the group's roadmap and features for all its projects. Individual projects
each have their own dedicated lead who serves as a point of contact and oversees
development for that respective project.

Nebula Labs's leadership is made of roles with different backgrounds who
oversee and assist with different aspects of development:

- President
- Vice President
- Executive Director
- Treasurer
- Secretary
- Head of Product
- Head of Engineering
- Head of Design
- Project Lead, Nebula Planner
- Project Lead, UTD Survival Guide
- Project Lead, API & Platform
- Project Lead, Jupiter
- Project Lead, UTD Trends

## Member Responsibilities

A Nebula Labs member is someone who monitors at least one project
and is responsible for maintaining its codebase, responding to issues,
performing code review for pull requests, fixing bugs, and developing or
designing new features when needed.

Each member chooses which projects they contribute to. Project Leads are
responsible for coordinating project timelines and being the ultimate
members for the projects they oversee. Any member may propose an idea
for a new project or tool maintained by Nebula Labs by proposing it to the
Head of Product.

## Contributors

A contributor is anyone who contributes code or some other IP to a project under
Nebula Labs. All Nebula Labs members are contributors.

All contributors are expected to act according to the Project's
[Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct).
