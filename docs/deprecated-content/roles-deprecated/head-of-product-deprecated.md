Nebula Labs is an initiative to build tools that help students. The Head of Product directs strategy by figuring out what student problems we should address next and how best to address them.

The Head of Product will keep in touch with external partners including students and university staff and third parties to increase the impact and utility of Nebula Labs’s projects.

## What You'll Do

The Head of Product oversees the functionality for Nebula Labs’s projects and determines their feasibility from a user perspective.

Additionally, Project’s Nebula’s Head of Product will brainstorm new features and solicit requests for proposals from the community for new projects.
