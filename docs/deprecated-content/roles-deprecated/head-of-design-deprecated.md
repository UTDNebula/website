## Overview

Nebula Labs is an initiative to build tools that help students. We strive to create interfaces and experiences that fit their needs.

The Head of Design takes on a more interdisciplinary role. The Head of Design maintains Nebula Labs’s identity and ensures that it fits the criteria of a college students’ work, but with the professionalism of a real company.

The Head of Design is responsible for making Nebula Labs appear friendly, inviting, and trustworthy. The role is also responsible for reinforcing those ideas throughout everything we create. Our goal is to shape Nebula Labs’s identity to align with the current design trends and create modern interfaces.

Nebula Labs uses a modern theme to format and create its programs. The Head of Design is expected to have a foundation in design that can tie into the current brand and visual identity. You will create graphics that are aesthetically pleasing to a college students’ eye.

## What We Need

The Head of Design is responsible for coming up with Nebula Labs’s identity and keeping it aligned with what features our projects offer and the needs of students.

- Ability to translate ideas
- Ability to respond well to feedback and critique

Any of these may additionally help:

- Experience designing vector graphics
