**TL;DR: We're kicking off a new chapter by becoming our own student organization.**

## What's Happening?

Project Nebula will become a registered student organization at UT Dallas,
separate from the student chapter of ACM that it has been affiliated with
until now.

We'll have to define our constitution and outline our other governing documents
like bylaws really soon, but everyone will be able to give their input.

## Why Independence?

The [Association for Computing Machinery](https://acmutd.co) (ACM) at UTD was a
student organization at UT Dallas that promotes the field of computing, largely
focusing on career-building activities in software development.

Harsha Srikara, a former technical lead for HackUTD in spring 2020, started ACM
Development, a group in ACM meant to promote software development through
practical projects. Project Nebula started as a single project: a degree planner
called Comet Planning. Aliah Shaira De Guzman started the original initiative in
May 2020 as a part of the Development team. I became the director of that team
(later renamed Engineering) in April 2021 and split my time between Project
Nebula and overseeing the rest of the Engineering Team for several months.
However, it was often difficult balancing the needs of the Engineering team with
Project Nebula, which was rapidly growing into a community of dozens of
contributors.

On March 9, 2022, Project Nebula's leadership and project leads met with ACM's
executives to discuss separating so each group could focus on its own mission.

Now, we're becoming our own distinct group so we can continue growing while
focusing on our mission. ACM will remain a part of the history of Project
Nebula, but it's time for a new chapter for our products and the community we've
built. This time, we will build a community in which every member is empowered
to lead others and contribute their perspective in supporting a central mission:
building a community of people who build tools that help others while sharing
their knowledge and having fun along the way.

Nebula is ultimately an experiment in creating tools for the community but also
creating a community in itself. It answers the question: can a bunch of nerds
govern themselves as they learn and build things together?

Let's find out.

## What Changes?

Mostly nothing.

Firstly, our name will better reflect our purpose. We've graduated from being a
mere project, so our name will change to reflect that.

I think the name **Nebula Labs** sounds cool and pays homage to our origins while
reflecting our status as a group. We incubate and maintain projects for the
community as an interdisciplinary community of people who learn and build
together.

Of course, nothing will be final until our contributors come to a consensus and
vote on the new name, but I have a good feeling about this one!

### Governance

Right now, senior leadership consists of an Executive Director, our Head of
Engineering, and our Head of Product. However, as we become our own student
organization, the scope of leadership will increase from focusing on solely
building our projects to growing and maintaining our community overall. As such,
there will be more administrative and support roles whose sole purpose will be
to serve as a foundation for our projects and other initiatives, based on our
desire to have contributors focus on building tools, learning skills, and
teaching others.

No matter what, maintainers and contributors will be an active part of how
Project Nebula operates. Everyone — whether a technical contributor or a
product designer — will be strongly encouraged to participate and give feedback
on how the community works.

### Funding and Operations

The most notable changes will come from how our group maintains our products. In
the coming months, we will secure our own funding sources to maintain our
operations as a student group and as a team that builds products for the
community.

Becoming our registered organization at UTD will give us programming and
operations funding from the [Student Organization Center](https://soc.utdallas.edu/).
Associating with the [Erik Jonsson School](https://engineering.utdallas.edu/) of
Engineering and Computer Science (ECS) will give us access to additional fixed
and variable funding to promote Project Nebula and have more events. (Yes, with
food!)

Additionally, as we open our own bank account, we will have more flexibility to
adopt alternative funding models like student donations (something UTD Grades
has done in the past) and finding sponsors. In the medium-term, we will have to
incorporate as a nonprofit. This will give us access to nonprofit pricing (often
free) for some services like [Google Workspace](https://www.google.com/nonprofits/workspace/compare/).

### Community

Product teams will still meet regularly with the cadence they do now. We'll
still have socials and other ways of maintaining our community. The Discord
server will continue to serve as our hub in conjunction with our projects on
[GitHub](https://github.com/UTDNebula) and our [website](http://about.utdnebula.com/docs/about/projects/overview).
Since we'll be able to reserve rooms on our own, we'll be able to host workshops
to share our knowledge to help others learn topics like software engineering and
UI/UX design. (Not to mention more socials!)

Our function-specific groups (Engineering, Product, Design) will now be called
guilds. Like they are now, guilds will be groups of contributors who are
interested. Guilds will take the lead for hosting domain-specific meet-ups and
events (e.g. designers will host design-related teach-ins for the community).

### Our Code

ACM UTD has agreed to give the Project Nebula maintainers full rights to the
code. Before, there was some ambiguity whether ACM UTD had ownership of the
code. For the code currently licensed to the Project Nebula maintainers, we will
be asking the permission of all contributors to relicense the code using the MIT
license to the organization we'll form so that our projects can be better
maintained in the long run while still respecting the rights of all contributors.
